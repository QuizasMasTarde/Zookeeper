# Zookeeper
My first project on the way to master Python with JetBrains

This is basically the first program that I wrote under Jet Brains' guidance, 
using some of the basic conepts, such as:
- data types
- functions
- variable
- lists
- taking input
- indexes
- boolean logic
- comparisons
- integer arithmetic
- if statement 
- while loop

Still confused about the code style though. Seems easy at first to follow the rules, 
however there are situations with several ways to solve the problem and it's not 
so obvious which one is best.
